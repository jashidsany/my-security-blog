# Hey, I'm Jashid 👋

I'm a security enthusiast diving deep into the world of offensive security, malware development, and Windows internals. This blog documents my learning journey — breaking things down so I (and hopefully you) can understand how they work under the hood.

## What I Write About

🔴 **Malware Development** — Building tools to understand how malware works, from shellcode loaders to process injection techniques.

🔴 **Windows Internals** — Exploring PE file structures, the Windows API, memory management, and how the OS really operates.

🔴 **Offensive Security** — Red team techniques, evasion methods, and practical security research.
